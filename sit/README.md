# Sitting

#### requires skript-reflect because I'm lazy

Allows sitting down on stairs, slabs, and carpets with right click. Also allows /sit, which makes the player sit down where they're standing, assuming it's on a solid block. Damage, relogging, shifting, or having the block beneath them broken will all cause the player to stand back up. Players stand up in the same location they sat down from, to prevent sitting from being a method of getting places they shouldn't be.

This is done through invisible armour stands that rotate in sync with the player. If they didn't rotate, the player's legs wouldn't turn with the player's head, leading to rather strange animations when someone pivots in a chair.
