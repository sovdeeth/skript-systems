# Priority Action Bars
Priority action bars are meant for servers that send many action bars from many different sources and don't want the less important action bars to override/drown out the more important ones. This skript implements a priority system where action bars can be sent with a duration and a priority level that prevents lower-priority bars from displaying for that duration.
