# Gradients

This is a function that colours text with a linear gradient. You give it the text that needs to be coloured, a string with the starting hex code ("18F7E5" for example), and a string with the ending hex code. The function returns the text coloured in a linear gradient between the two given colours. 

This also includes two helper functions for converting between hexadecimal and decimal.
