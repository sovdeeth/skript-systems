# System Messages
This skript is a more robust and standardized way to return feedback to players when something server-related should be communicated. 

It automatically formats a string with a coloured prefix based on the importantance of the system message, ranging from 'info' to 'error', and allows objects to be automatically inserted into a string with proper colouring.
It can highlight a player name inserted into a string and de-highlight after the name.

The main benefit of this is that servers can more easily control the colours in their chats, allowing the entire pallette to be swapped with the change of a few variables or options instead of manually changing colors in every string sent to players.
