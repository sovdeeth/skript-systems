# Auto-generated Parkour

### Note: this has not been maintained or updated for a while. Use with caution.

Generates a random parkour path between two points. The jumps should always be do-able, but the code doesn't really like obstacles in its way. I advise running it a few times until you get what you want.

`!generateParkour({start-loc}, {end-loc}, white concrete)`
