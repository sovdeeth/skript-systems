# Parabolas

**Uses SkBee to draw particles**

Draws a parabola with particles given a vertex and a point. Very useful for building bridges (arches are parabolas under load, and so are the cables of suspension bridges). The particles are only shown to the player in the function.

`!drawParabola({vertex}, {point}, player)`
