# World Edit CUI in Skript

**requires skript-reflect, worldedit plugin, as well as the worldedit plugin jar place in the skript-reflect plugin folder.**

This skript will outline your current selection, given that your selection is the normal cuboid, the sphere, ellipsoid, or 2d polygon (//sel poly).
Otherwise, it will show the cuboid bounding box of your selection, which will not be accurate to the blocks that will be changed.

You should ideally use the actual worldedit cui mod, as it's much better in every aspect, but this exists for fun and if the mod isn't updated. Enjoy.
