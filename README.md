# skript-systems
Collection of useful systems in skript. 

Most will come with a vanilla/minimal addon version and a skript-reflect version.

The skript-reflect version will generally use custom effects/expressions and take advantage of java classes and functions.
The vanilla/minimal version will usually use functions with occasional commands. If skript-reflect is included in the minimal list, there will only be a single version, using skript reflect custom effects and expressions.

These are meant to be general, powerful skripts you can add to your server and take advantage of. Ideally you would edit the skripts to best suit your server, with more specific effects and parameters, as they are rather generic in their current form for that reason. They should all be plug and play.

If you have advice/concerns/issues, message me on discord at Sovde#0001 and make it clear that you are messaging about my systems.
