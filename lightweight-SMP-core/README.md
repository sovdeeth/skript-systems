This will, when completed:
- provide a chat with custom formatting and standardized system messages. 
- provide moderation commands, including banning, muting, and kicking, as well as a punishment history. 
- have shortcuts for commands like /gamemode 
- include a custom tablist with server information. 
- provide an afk system to flag inactive players and kick after a certain period.
- remind you to install core-inspect. 

TOOD
