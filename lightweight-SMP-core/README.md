# Lightweight SMP Core

This will, when completed:
- provide a chat with custom formatting and standardized system messages. 
- provide moderation commands, including banning, muting, and kicking, as well as a punishment history. 
- have shortcuts for commands like /gamemode 
- include a custom tablist with server information. 
- provide an afk system to flag inactive players and kick after a certain period.
- remind you to install core-inspect. 

Other skripts you might consider adding include:
- my inventory backup system.
- my /home system (WIP)


TODO:
- tab name updates, with nicknames/colour/afk
- core-inspect reminder
- rewrite afk system to be more understandable
- options-ify everything
